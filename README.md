# Coffee Sales Insights 2023 - Power BI Project
My primary goal behind creating this small project is to practice designing insightful visualizations (heatmaps, matrix, treemaps, bar charts, etc.) and drawing actionable conclusions based on the data. I used a public dataset from Kaggle, pertaining to coffee sales from January to June of 2023. While the data is fictitious, it focuses on key metrics, trends, and patterns in sales performance. Through this project, I learned how to design an interactive report while also utilizing DAX to create custom metrics.

## Skills demonstrated
- Power BI, DAX, data modeling, and visualization.

## Files Included
- `Coffee Sales Insights (2023).pbix`: Power BI project file.
- `Coffee Sales Insights (2023).pdf`: Report in PDF format.
- `Coffee Sales Insights (2023).pptx`: PowerPoint to conclude findings from data
- `Coffee_Sales_Dataset`: Link to Kaggle dataset.

## Viewing the Project
- Download the `.pbix` file and open it in Power BI Desktop to interact with the visualizations. Otherwise, to simply to view the visualizations, open the PDF.
- Open `Coffee Sales Insights (2023).pptx` to view related questions and answers (analyzing the visuals and drawing conclusions).
